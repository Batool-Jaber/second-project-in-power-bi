## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution built using Power BI to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, product profitability, and shipping efficiency in an e-commerce environment similar to Amazon.

The project follows a real-world data analytics lifecycle:
Raw data → Data cleaning → Data modeling → DAX measures → Interactive dashboards → Business insights.

- Central Date Table for time intelligence.

### DAX Measures
I created all analytical measures including:

## Team Contributions

This was a collaborative team project.

Each team member was responsible for designing one analytical dashboard page 
based on the data model and measures I created.

Their role focused mainly on:
- Visual design of their individual page.
- Building charts and tables for their assigned topic.

All pages were integrated into one unified system under a single data model and analytical framework.
